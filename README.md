# Google Homepage (The Odin Project)

This is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course.<br />
The aim of this project is to create a mock-up of the Google homepage layout in order to practise HTML and CSS basics.

<br />
The skills learned and demonstrated in this project include the following:

1. Using tags such as &lt;nav>, &lt;main>, and &lt;footer> to structure a webpage
2. Using CSS properties to create a flexible dynamic layout
3. Getting CSS properties to change depending on states such as 'active' or 'hover'
4. Using SVG paths or background images as icons
5. Using media queries to account for different screen sizes (see the footer layout)

<br />
Areas for further development when I learn more:

1. Having the 'X' (clear button) appear when you start typing in the search field
2. Adding a mock-up of the search results page
3. Adding a drop-down menu when you click on the 'dots' button
4. Adding a mock sign in function
